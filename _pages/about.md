Welcome to my website! Here, I post about my intellectual journey. 


About Me
======
I am currently in my 3rd year studying Computer Science at the University of Southern California (USC) as a PhD Student with my advisor, Prof. Maja Matarić, in the Interaction Lab. Prior to USC, I worked as a Research Analyst for projects related to automatic speech recognition for low-resource African languages (with Professor Ian Lane and Yinka Iyinolakan of CDIAL) and analyzing dehumanization in social media (with Dr. Adwait Ratnaparkhi) at the University of California, Santa Cruz, in the Natural Language Processing department. I completed a B.S. in Computer Science and an M.S. in Natural Language Processing from the University of California, Santa Cruz.
